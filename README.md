# Mathematics & Data

## About me

After graduating in Mathematics from Universidad Nacional de Cordoba (Argentina), my life took some unexpected turns and I started moving around the world a lot. In the past 3 years I have been living in Italy, Sweden and now in the US. In my free time I do a lot of reading and exercise is my non-negotiable.
